# Image-Processing-Project
In this project, Python/OpenCV is used to implement image processing algorithm to fulfill EECE 680D class requirement. 
We developed a code to implement Manifold SLIC: A Fast Method to Compute Content-Sensitive Superpixels paper.
SLIC and MSLIC algorithms are implemented using Python/OpenCV, and performance are measured with tests on Lena, and BSDS500 datasets.
